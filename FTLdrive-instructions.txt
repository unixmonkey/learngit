Call Scotty.

Star Trek doesn't call it FTL.

Within the confines of what we perceive as the physical universe, travel
faster than light is likely impossible.  However, the more interesting
questions are around the nature of reality.  Does distance actually exist?
Can we simply shift to another peceived contextual location without passing
through what we perceived to be the continous collection of locations in
between?  Rather than calling Scotty, we would be better served to call the
author of the rules of this existence and request access to temporarily
operate outside its rules.  Thus, call God.  Examples exist of faster than
light travel, Philip, Enoch, or perhaps they didn't travel at all.
